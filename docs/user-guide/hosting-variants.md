# Hosting Variants
## Host (Default)
On the *Windows* host, a single VM is exclusively utilized as the *Linux* control-plane node while the *Windows* host itself functions as the worker node.

This variant is also the default, offering efficient and very low memory consumption. The VM's memory usage starts at 2GB.<br/><br/>
