# GPU Node

The `gpu-node` addon configures the K2s control-plane Linux VM as a GPU node so that Kubernetes pods can request and use the NVIDIA GPU of the Windows host machine. GPU access is shared between the Windows host and the Linux VM simultaneously.

!!! info "Supported hosting variants"
    The `gpu-node` addon is fully supported on both **Hyper-V** and **WSL2** K2s setups. GPU access uses the GPU paravirtualization (GPU-PV) mechanism in both cases.

GPU workloads are scheduled via the [NVIDIA Device Plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) using the **CDI (Container Device Interface)** injection model — the same approach used by upstream Kubernetes.

---

## Prerequisites

- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** must be installed on the Windows host. The WSL infrastructure provides the GPU paravirtualization library (`libdxcore.so`) that is required by both the Hyper-V and WSL2 hosting variants. No Linux distribution is needed:
  ```console
  wsl --install --no-distribution
  ```

- **NVIDIA drivers** must be installed on the Windows host before enabling the addon.
  Download from: [https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

!!! note
    A reboot of the Windows host may be required after installing either component.

- For **WSL2 hosting variant**: after installing or updating NVIDIA drivers you must restart the K2s cluster before enabling the addon:
  ```console
  k2s stop
  k2s start
  ```

---

## Enabling the Addon

### Exclusive GPU access (default)

Each pod gets exclusive access to the physical GPU:

```console
k2s addons enable gpu-node
```

### GPU time-slicing (shared access)

To allow multiple pods to share the GPU simultaneously, use the `--time-slices` flag:

```console
k2s addons enable gpu-node --time-slices 4
```

This configures the NVIDIA device plugin to advertise `4` virtual GPU slots backed by one physical GPU. Any integer from `2` to `16` is accepted. CUDA time-slicing handles multiplexing transparently — pods see `nvidia.com/gpu: 1` each and execute concurrently.

!!! warning
    Time-slicing shares **compute time** but does **not** partition GPU memory. All pods on the same physical GPU share the same memory pool. Use exclusive mode (`--time-slices 1`) for workloads with large VRAM requirements.

---

## Checking Status

```console
k2s addons status gpu-node
```

The status output reports:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `IsDevicePluginRunning` | Whether the NVIDIA Device Plugin DaemonSet is ready |
| `IsDCGMExporterRunning` | Whether the DCGM metrics exporter is running (see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations)) |
| `NodeGpuLabels` | Whether the control-plane node has `gpu=true` and `accelerator=nvidia` labels |
| `GpuAllocatable` | Number of GPU slots advertised to Kubernetes (reflects time-slicing replicas) |
| `GpuInUse` | Number of GPU slots currently held by running pods |
| `ExternalGpuWorkers` | Count and names of external GPU-capable worker nodes (auto-detected when NVIDIA GPU is present) |

---

## Hosting a GPU Pod

### Pod spec

Pods request GPU access by declaring a resource limit on `nvidia.com/gpu`. No `runtimeClassName` is required:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-gpu-workload
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - name: workload
      image: <your-cuda-image>
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

The NVIDIA Device Plugin allocates a GPU slot and injects the following into the container via CDI annotations:

| Resource | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Device | `/dev/dxg` | DirectX GPU device for WSL2/GPU-PV |
| Libraries | `/usr/lib/wsl/lib` | CUDA runtime (`libcuda.so`), D3D12 (`libd3d12.so`), dxcore (`libdxcore.so`) |
| Drivers | `/usr/lib/wsl/drivers` | Vendor-specific drivers (e.g., `libnvwgf2umx.so` for NVIDIA OpenGL via D3D12) |

The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable is also set to `/usr/lib/wsl/lib` so that applications can discover GPU libraries at runtime.

### Targeting the GPU node explicitly

The control-plane node is automatically labeled `gpu=true` and `accelerator=nvidia` when the addon is enabled. Use these labels in `nodeSelector` to pin GPU workloads to it:

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    gpu: "true"
    accelerator: nvidia
```

This is useful in multi-node K2s setups where you want to ensure the pod lands on the GPU node.

### Requesting multiple slots (time-slicing only)

When time-slicing is enabled with e.g. `--time-slices 4`, you can schedule up to 4 pods each requesting one slot:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1   # each pod requests one slot; up to 4 can run concurrently
```

Requesting more than 1 `nvidia.com/gpu` per pod is not supported with time-slicing.

---

## Sample CUDA Workload

The following pod runs the NVIDIA vectorAdd CUDA sample to verify GPU allocation and compute access:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-test
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - name: gpu-test
      image: nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/cuda-sample:vectoradd-cuda11.7.1
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

```console
kubectl apply -f gpu-test.yaml
kubectl wait pod gpu-test --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Succeeded --timeout=120s
kubectl logs gpu-test
kubectl delete pod gpu-test
```

Expected output:

```
[Vector addition of 50000 elements]
Copy input data from the host memory to the CUDA device
CUDA kernel launch with 196 blocks of 256 threads
Copy output data from the CUDA device to the host memory
Test PASSED
```

This works on both Hyper-V GPU-PV and WSL2 setups.

---

## Offline Usage

In air-gapped environments where the Linux VM cannot reach the internet, use the export/import workflow:

```console
# On a machine with internet access:
k2s addons export gpu-node -d C:\Exports

# Transfer the exported .oci.tar file to the restricted host, then:
k2s addons import gpu-node -f C:\Exports\gpu-node_*.oci.tar

# Now enable normally — no internet required:
k2s addons enable gpu-node
```

---

## External GPU Worker Nodes

In addition to the KubeMaster VM, you can add external Linux machines with NVIDIA GPUs as GPU-capable worker nodes. This enables scaling GPU workloads across multiple physical machines.

### Prerequisites for External GPU Workers

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **NVIDIA kernel drivers** | Must be pre-installed on the external Linux machine. Verify with `nvidia-smi`. |

!!! warning "Driver Installation"
    K2s does **not** install NVIDIA kernel drivers. Install them using your distribution's package manager or NVIDIA's official installer **before** running `k2s node add`.

### Online Workflow (Internet Available)

When the target machine has internet access, GPU support is **automatically detected and configured**:

```console
k2s node add --ip-addr 192.168.1.50 --username admin
```

**What happens automatically when an NVIDIA GPU is detected:**

1. Verifies NVIDIA drivers are functional (`nvidia-smi`)
2. Downloads and installs NVIDIA Container Toolkit packages
3. Configures CRI-O runtime with CDI (Container Device Interface) support
4. Labels the node with `gpu=true` and `accelerator=nvidia`

If no NVIDIA GPU is detected (or a non-NVIDIA GPU like AMD/Intel is present), GPU configuration is skipped and the node joins as a regular worker.

### Offline Workflow (Air-Gapped Environment)

For environments without internet access, create a GPU-enabled node package first.

**Step 1: Create the GPU node package** (on a machine with an installed and running *K2s* cluster)

```console
k2s system package --node-package --os debian13 --include-gpu --target-dir C:\packages --name debian13-gpu.zip
```

!!! note
    Node package creation requires an installed and running *K2s* cluster. The local cluster proxy `http://172.19.1.1:8181` is used by default to download the GPU artifacts, so `--proxy` does not need to be specified; pass `-p` only to override it.

The `--include-gpu` flag downloads and bundles:

- NVIDIA Container Toolkit `.deb` packages (`libnvidia-container1`, `libnvidia-container-tools`, `nvidia-container-runtime`, `nvidia-container-toolkit`)
- GPU device plugin container image (`nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s-device-plugin`)

**Step 2: Transfer the package** to the air-gapped environment.

**Step 3: Add the GPU worker node**

```console
k2s node add --ip-addr 192.168.1.50 --username admin --node-package C:\packages\debian13-gpu.zip
```

GPU support is configured automatically if:

- The target node has an NVIDIA GPU (detected via `nvidia-smi`)
- The node package includes GPU packages (created with `--include-gpu`)

!!! note "Without `--include-gpu`"
    If the node package was created **without** `--include-gpu`, GPU configuration will be skipped even if the target has an NVIDIA GPU. Create a new package with `--include-gpu` to enable GPU support.

### Lifecycle Notes

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| GPU worker added **before** addon enabled | Worker is labeled; device plugin deploys when addon is enabled |
| GPU worker added **after** addon enabled | Worker is labeled; device plugin pod starts automatically |
| Addon disabled | Device plugin removed; GPU labels preserved on workers |
| Addon re-enabled | Device plugin redeploys to all GPU-labeled nodes |

### Checking GPU Workers

```console
# List all GPU-capable nodes
kubectl get nodes -l gpu=true

# Check addon status (includes external worker count)
k2s addons status gpu-node
```

---

## Disabling the Addon

```console
k2s addons disable gpu-node
```

This removes the Device Plugin and DCGM Exporter DaemonSets, uninstalls the NVIDIA Container Toolkit packages from the Linux VM, reverts the GRUB boot entry to the default kernel (Hyper-V only), removes the GPU partition adapter from the VM (Hyper-V only), and removes the `gpu=true` / `accelerator=nvidia` node labels.

---

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **DCGM-Exporter not deployed** | NVML is unavailable on the dxcore/D3D12 driver path used by both WSL2 and Hyper-V GPU-PV. Because K2s only supports GPU-PV, the DCGM-Exporter DaemonSet is **not deployed** (it would crash-loop). `nvidia-smi` works for basic UUID queries. CUDA workloads are unaffected. |
| **`nvidia-smi` reports limited info** | Only UUID queries work reliably. Power draw, temperature, and utilization queries are not available via dxcore. |
| **Single GPU only** | Only one physical GPU is exposed to the VM per K2s node. Multi-GPU passthrough is not supported. |
| **Hyper-V requirement** | GPU-PV (Hyper-V path) requires Windows 10 version 20H1 (build 19041) or later and a GPU with a WDDM 2.9+ driver. |
