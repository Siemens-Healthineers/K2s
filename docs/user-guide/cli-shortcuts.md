# CLI Shortcuts
To interact with the *K2s* cluster, the following shortcuts can be used:

## Krew support

*K2s* bundles [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/){target="_blank"}, the official *kubectl* plugin
manager, together with *kubectl* on **both** the Windows host and the Linux control-plane node. Krew is
part of the offline package, so no additional download is required — after installing *K2s* you can
immediately run:

=== "Windows host"

    ```powershell
    kubectl krew version
    ```

=== "Linux control-plane"

    ```console
    kubectl krew version
    ```

!!! note
    Installing plugins (for example `kubectl krew install ctx`) fetches the plugin index and packages
    from the internet and is therefore an online, user-initiated action. It is never performed during
    *K2s* installation, preserving *K2s*'s offline guarantees. *K2s* bundles Krew itself, but never
    bundles or installs plugins.

Krew installs plugins into a per-user directory, which *K2s* adds to `PATH` for the user that installed
*K2s* so that installed plugins are discoverable right away:

| Platform | Plugin directory | How `PATH` is configured |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Windows  | `%USERPROFILE%\.krew\bin` | User-scope `PATH` of the installing user |
| Linux control-plane | `$HOME/.krew/bin` | `~/.profile` of the node user |

Any additional user follows Krew's standard
[one-time PATH setup](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/){target="_blank"} to
expose their own plugins.

Plugins are **user-owned state**: *K2s* never backs up, migrates, upgrades or deletes `~/.krew`
(`%USERPROFILE%\.krew` on Windows). Plugins therefore survive a *K2s* upgrade and are not removed by
`k2s uninstall`. Use `kubectl krew upgrade` to update plugins yourself.
