## *L2Bridge*
Creation of *L2Bridge* is essential for communication between *Pods* across *Linux* and *Windows* nodes. In principle, a network adapter named `cbr0` is created to facilitate communication across nodes.

## *DNSProxy*
Acts as internal DNS server on *Windows* node. Status can be checked with cmd `nssm status dnsproxy`.

## *HttpProxy*
Internal proxy running on *Windows* node. Status can be checked with cmd `nssm status httpproxy`.

In order to access resources on the internet the following proxy settings need to be used:

- *Host*: Proxy `http://172.19.1.1:8181` needs to be used inside *Linux* *Pods* and *Windows* *Pods*. The *Linux* node needs the proxy as well.
- *Linux-only*: No proxy needs to be used. Internet access is possible through NAT.

!!! example
    ```console
    curl www.example.com --proxy http://172.19.1.1:8181
    ```

## *VFPRules*
Dynamic rules added in `cbr0` switch for *Windows* containers networking.
