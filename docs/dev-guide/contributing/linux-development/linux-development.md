## Remote Linux Development via SSH and VS Code

### 1\. Create SSH Config File

- On your Windows machine, open the file `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\config` (create it if it doesn’t exist).
- Add the following entry, adjusting paths and IP as needed:

  - HostName is the IP address of your Linux VM created after K2s installation.
  - User is the username you set up during K2s installation (default is `remote`)
  - After K2s is successfully installed, `id_rsa` file is created in `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\K2s\id_rsa` and is the private key used to connect to the Linux VM.
- Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual Windows username.

### 2\. Install Remote-SSH Extension in VS Code

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for `Remote - SSH`, and install it.

- VS Code will open a new window connected to your Linux VM.

### 4\. Clone a Repository on Linux and Develop from Windows Using VS Code

- In the remote VS Code window, open the terminal (`Ctrl+\``).
- Run: check if internet is working by using following command - curl -vvv https://google.com
  - If above curl command doesnt return 200 response, you need to set proxy in the terminal using following command 
      - export http_proxy=http://172.19.1.1:8181 export https_proxy=https://172.19.1.1:8181 - But this is temporary and will be lost when you close the terminal.
      - To make it permanent, you need to add proxy to ~/.bashrc file.

      - Add proxy to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf → so apt update and apt install work.

- To clone a repository, run the following commands (replace `<repo-url>` with your repository URL):
  - Install Git if its not already present in linux vm
    - bash
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install git
  - Goto any folder and Clone a repository for example git clone <repo-url> .
- Open the cloned repo folder in VS Code (`File > Open Folder...`).
