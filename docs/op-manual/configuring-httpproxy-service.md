# Configuring *HTTPProxy* Service
The *HTTPProxy* service is a proxy server that can be used to provide external network access to virtual machines running in *Hyper-V* without setting up a *NAT* network. 

During *K2s* installation, *HTTPProxy* is deployed as a *Windows* Service.

By default, *HTTPProxy* service listens for requests on **ALL** available interfaces at port `8181`.

The logs for *HTTPProxy* service are in directory `<installation-drive>\var\log\httpproxy`. For example, if *K2s* is installed in directory `D:\k2s` then *HTTPProxy* service logs will be available in directory `D:\var\log\httpproxy`.

## Customizing *HTTPProxy* Listen Port
*HTTPProxy* can be started on a different port using the `addr` parameter. For example, if we want to start *HTTPProxy* service on *Windows 10 Hyper-V* host at port `30000`, then the it can be achieved as follows:
```console
httpproxy --addr ":30000"
```
To edit the *Windows* service deployed by *K2s*, you can use [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/){target="_blank"} to modify the parameters with which the service is started by adding `--addr ":30000"` as shown below:

## Configuring Forward Proxy
In some cases, the *Windows 10* host itself receives internet connection via an internet proxy. In these cases, the *HTTPProxy* service must forward the requests to this internet proxy.

This can be achieved by using the `--forward-proxy` parameter as shown below:
```console
httpproxy --forward-proxy http://someproxyhost:8080
```
In the above example, the internet proxy is available on URL `http://someproxyhost:8080`. In this case, the outgoing requests are forwarded to the internet through *HTTPProxy* via the the internet proxy.

Using the *NSSM* UI, it can be achieved as shown below:

### Configuring `NO_PROXY` with Forward Proxy
In some case, when the *Windows 10* host receives internet connection via an internet proxy, certain requests are not meant to be forwarded to the internet. For example, we would want to pull a container image from a container registry hosted over the intranet. In these cases, the environment variable `NO_PROXY` can be appropriately configured on the host or in the *NSSM* UI.

For example, we want to pull images from a container registry `registry.internal.com` we can configure the `NO_PROXY` variable as follows:
```title=""
NO_PROXY=registry.internal.com
```
Multiple hosts or domain names can be specified in `NO_PROXY` separated by a comma as shown below:
```title=""
NO_PROXY=172.16.12.3,registry1.internal.com,registry2.internal.com,.internal.io
```
In the above example, `.internal.io` is used to represent domain `internal.io`.
Similarly, we can also configure IP addresses in `NO_PROXY`. However, adding *Network CIDRs* or subnets is not supported.

The `NO_PROXY` environment variable can be configured as a system environment variable or as a process environment variable. For *HTTPProxy* *Windows* service, we can set the `NO_PROXY` as a process environment variable in the *Environment* tab of the *NSSM*'s *Edit* UI as shown below:

## Configuring Listen Interfaces
In some cases, *HTTPProxy* should be used to provide internet access to only certain networks. In this case, we can specify the *Network CIDRs* of the interfaces for which *HTTPProxy* must provide internet access.

For example, if *HTTPProxy* must provide internet access to network with CIDR `192.19.1.0/24` and `192.20.0.0/16`, then we can start the *HTTPProxy* service with the following parameters:
```title=""
httpproxy --allowed-cidr 192.19.1.0/24 --allowed-cidr 192.20.0.0/16
```
In this case, only the virtual machines, running in the two configured networks, would have internet access. 

In the *NSSM* UI, we can add additional interfaces using `--allowed-cidr` to the service parameters:
