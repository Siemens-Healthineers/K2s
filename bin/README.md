# Some small batch files

These are meant to make daily life with the small K8s setup easier.
They provide some 1..3 character shortcuts for often used commands in the
Kubernetes world

## Usage

You can either add this directory directly to your user PATH, if you want
to use all the scripts 'as is'

Alternatively, cherry-pick the ones that you need and copy them into another directory,
which is in your PATH.

## Changes

Do not check in any changes that are local for you or your machine, please.
Instead, copy the file to some local directory and change it there.

## Why not Doskey?

The same could be achieved with some DOSKEY macros.
Yet, the approach with the *.cmd files has the advantage that it works
both in cmd.exe as well as in PowerShell. No need to keep two different
alias definition files in sync.

# Some *.exe files

To avoid another directory in the PATH, we put some *.exe here as well, which shall
be reachable from everywhere.

<`installation folder`>\bin is in PATH, <`installation folder`>\bin\exe is not!
