# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The K2s project treats security vulnerabilities seriously, so we
strive to take action quickly when required.

The project requests that security issues be disclosed in a responsible
manner to allow adequate time to respond.  If a security issue or
vulnerability has been found, please disclose the details to our
dedicated email address:

dieter.krotz@siemens-healthineers.com

Please include as much information as possible with the report. The
following details assist with analysis efforts:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Affected component (version, commit, branch etc)
  - Affected code (file path, line numbers)
  - Exploit code

## Security Team

The security team currently consists of the Maintainers of K2s.
