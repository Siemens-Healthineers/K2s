# Overview
This folder contains *provider* packages: adapters (in the ports-and-adapters/hexagonal sense) that reach outside the system into its environment, e.g. the file system, OS users, SSH/SFTP connections, HTTP endpoints, `kubectl`/Kubernetes and kubeconfig files.

Each subfolder is one provider and should only contain the technical integration code needed to talk to that specific external dependency. Business/orchestration logic that uses a provider belongs elsewhere (e.g. `internal/core`), consuming providers through narrow interfaces rather than depending on their concrete types.
