# Overview
This folder holds *some* of K2s's domain logic: the rules and workflows that define *what* the system does, as opposed to *how* it talks to the outside world. Packages here orchestrate one or more [providers](../providers/README.md) and enforce business rules on top (validation, naming conventions, admission checks, config parsing).

Not all K2s domain logic lives here: this is not the single place to look for business rules; plenty of it is still scattered across other Go packages, PowerShell modules and scripts.

Most packages here follow IOSP (Integration Operation Segregation Principle): integration files wire together concrete [providers](../providers/README.md) directly and hold no logic of their own (and therefore no unit tests), while the actual rules sit in "leaf" operation functions/packages, which depend on narrow provider interfaces instead and are unit-tested.
