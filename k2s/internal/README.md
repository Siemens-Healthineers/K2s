# Overview
This folder contains all re-usable *Go* packages that cannot be referenced from outside this repo.

Even though they have interdependencies, the aim is to keep their coupling as low as possible. As of now, these packages have different levels of abstraction. Therefore, future refactoring towards a cleaner differentiation is needed.
