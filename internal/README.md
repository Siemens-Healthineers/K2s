# Overview
This folder contains all re-usable *Go* packages that cannot be referenced from outside this repo.

Even though they have interdependencies, the aim is to keep their coupling as low as possible.

Packages follow a layered architecture: `core` orchestrates domain logic using `contracts` and calls into `providers` through the `provider` interface abstraction. Platform-specific implementations live in build-tagged files (Windows/Linux) and provider adapters, while utility packages provide shared functionality across layers.

## Core & Architecture Packages

| Package      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core/`      | Domain logic and workflows: cluster lifecycle, addons, config parsing, user management, admission rules — see [core/README.md](core/README.md)                                             |
| `contracts/` | Shared models (config, users) referenced by both `core` and `providers`, avoiding unwanted dependencies and import cycles — see [contracts/README.md](contracts/README.md)                 |
| `provider/`  | **Platform-agnostic provider interfaces** and build-tagged implementations for Windows and Linux. Commands use these interfaces exclusively — see [provider/README.md](provider/README.md) |
| `providers/` | Concrete adapter packages: Kubernetes, SSH, kubectl, kubeconfig utilities — see [providers/README.md](providers/README.md)                                                                 |

## Platform-Specific Packages

| Package                | Purpose                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setuporchestration/`  | Linux-native cluster provisioning (kubeadm, libvirt/KVM, SSH) |
| `windows/`             | Windows-specific utilities and native Go operations           |
| `linux/`               | Linux-specific utilities and native Go operations             |
| `containernetworking/` | Windows CNI bridge plugin logic                               |

## Dependency Analysis

The dependencies can be analyzed with *Go* tooling, e.g.:

- Install [*Goda*](https://github.com/loov/goda):
    ```sh
    go install github.com/loov/goda@latest
    ```
- Install [*Graphviz*](https://graphviz.org/download/#windows)
- Generate graph:
    ```sh
    goda graph github.com/siemens-healthineers/k2s/internal/... | dot -Tsvg -o graph-internal.svg
    ```
