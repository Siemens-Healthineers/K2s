# K2s (Kubernetes) Setup 
[![ci](https://github.com/Siemens-Healthineers/K2s/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Siemens-Healthineers/K2s/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

***WORK IN PROGRESS ...***

This **K2s** solution is a Kubernetes (K8s) distribution which packages different components
into one small and easy to use solution for development and testing purposes. It has its focus on running mixed Windows & Linux workloads in Kubernetes and it's available on Windows hosts.

#### Why this **K2s** distribution ?

The problems that **K2s** solves are the following:
1. It offers the possibility to build a K8s cluster by reusing the Windows host as a node.
By this no extra Windows license is needed for a mixed Windows & Linux cluster
2. It's build on 100% open source, no additional licenses needed
3. Very low footprint by only having one virtual machine for the Linux workloads (Hyper-V or WSL)
4. It offers an easy path for migrating bare metal Windows applications to K8s workloads

The name **K2s** comes from the fact that we start with the default setting of 2 K8s nodes (Windows & Linux) and it relates to K8s with the intention to solve the problems mentioned above.

See [Features](/doc/K8s_Features.md) for a full list of features.

#### Supported OS Versions

#### It offers these variants in hosting the K8s workloads:
1. **Host Variant**: here on the Windows host only one Virtual Machine is created and used as the Linux master and worker node.
This variant is also the default, it offers very low memory consumption and efficiency. Memory usage starts at 4GB.

2. **Multi VM Variant**: for each node one virtual machine is created, minimum we have one Windows and one Linux node. Memory usage here starts at 10GB.

3. **Development Only Variant**: in this variant we don't create a K8s cluster, only the environment to be able to build and test Windows and Linux containers.

In addition to offering a K8s cluster setup, the **K2s** solution also provides tools for building and testing Windows and Linux container.

For development only cases where no K8s is needed and the focus is only on building and testing containers (Windows & Linux), **K2s** offers a
way to do that.
