*K2s* is a *Kubernetes* distribution which packages different open-source components into one small and easy to use solution focusing on running mixed *Windows*-based & *Linux*-based workloads in *Kubernetes*. 

This solution is installable on *Windows* hosts.

The name *K2s* comes from the fact that we start with the default setting of 2 *Kubernetes* nodes (*Windows* & *Linux*) and it relates to *K8s* as synonym for *Kubernetes*.

## Why *K2s*?
The problems that *K2s* solves are the following:

- It provides the option to construct a *K8s* cluster by reusing the *Windows* host as a node. This eliminates the need for an extra *Windows* license in the case of a mixed *Windows* & *Linux* cluster.
- Offline support is available for all use cases, eliminating the requirement for an internet connection.
- It offers an easy path for migrating bare metal *Windows* applications to *K8s* workloads.
- It maintains a low footprint by utilizing a single virtual machine for *Linux* workloads (*Hyper-V* or WSL).
- It is built 100% on open-source technology, requiring no additional licenses.
