# The opensearch-dashboards service exposes a web application on port 5601
# It is uses a very tricky design to solve the problem of relative paths:
# in the deployment.yaml, we configure these environment variables:
# SERVER_BASEPATH = "/logging": the application will generate all relative
#    URLs starting with this prefix!
# SERVER_REWRITEBASEPATH = "true": the application will expect the
# incoming calls to be part of the request path (needed for port forwarding)
---
# this ingress will be merged with ingress provided in:
# addons/ingress/traefik/manifests/cluster-local-ingress.yaml
# and exposes the opensearch-dashboards angular application on:
# https://k2s.cluster.local/logging
