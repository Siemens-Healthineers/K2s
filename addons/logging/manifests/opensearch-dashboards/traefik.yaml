# The opensearch-dashboards service exposes a web application on port 5601
# It is uses a very tricky design to solve the problem of relative paths:
# in the deployment.yaml, we configure these environment variables:
# SERVER_BASEPATH = "/logging": the application will generate all relative
#    URLs starting with this prefix!
# SERVER_REWRITEBASEPATH = "false": the application will NOT expect the
# incoming calls to be part of the request path
# This gives us the flexibility to expose the application on the configured
# path, in this case "/logging"
---
# This middleware trips the prefix "/logging" from the request, if present
# is is used below in
# 'traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares' annotation

# This ingress will expose the opensearch-dashboards web application on:
# HTTP: http://k2s-logging.cluster.local
# TLS: https://k2s-logging.cluster.local
# For TLS, the certificate is taken from k8s secret 'k2s-logging-local-tls'
# This secret will be created by cert-manager, if it is running.
# If cert-manager is not running, the secret will not be present and traefik
# will use an own self-signed certificate.
