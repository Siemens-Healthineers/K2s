# prepare-ceph-osd-host.sh  -  Debian (12/13) variant
#
# Prepares THIS machine to join an existing cephadm-managed Ceph cluster as an OSD host.
# cephadm manages cluster hosts over SSH as root using the cluster's own key pair
# (/etc/ceph/ceph.pub on the bootstrap/MGR node). K2s always bootstraps with --ssh-user root so
# that external OSD nodes with different K2s usernames are handled uniformly. For cephadm to add
# this host and deploy OSD daemons, the cluster public key must be authorized for root login and
# root key-based SSH must be enabled.
#
# This script automates the manual host-preparation steps:
#   Install a container runtime (podman) and lvm2 - both required by cephadm to deploy an OSD
#   daemon and carve the OSD out of a raw drive (cephadm supports podman as its container engine):
#     - sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
#     - sudo apt install -y podman
#     - sudo apt install -y lvm2
#   Authorize the cephadm cluster key for root SSH:
#     1. sudo cat /etc/ceph/ceph.pub        (run on the MGR node to obtain the key -> pass as arg)
#     2. sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
#     3. sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
#     4. append the key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
#     5. sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
#     6. enable PermitRootLogin (prohibit-password) + PubkeyAuthentication in sshd
#     7. sudo systemctl restart ssh
#
# Invoked remotely (Invoke-RemoteScript) or run directly on the OSD host.
#
# Arguments (order-independent):
#   The cephadm cluster public key (contents of /etc/ceph/ceph.pub on the MGR node). An OpenSSH
#     public key contains spaces (type + base64 blob + optional comment); it may be passed either
#     quoted as one argument or as several space-separated arguments - they are reassembled.
#   Optional HTTP/HTTPS proxy URL (e.g. the K2s transparent proxy http://<kubeswitch-ip>:8181).
#     The proxy is recognised by its 'http://' or 'https://' prefix, so it can appear before or
#     after the key without being confused with a key fragment.
#   Optional Ceph container image reference (e.g. quay.io/ceph/ceph:v20). Recognised by containing
#     both '/' and ':' (registry/repo:tag). When provided, the image is pulled locally via the
#     proxy so cephadm can deploy the crash/OSD daemons and run ceph-volume on this host without
#     reaching the public registry (which fails on air-gapped OSD nodes).
#
# Examples:
#   ./prepare-ceph-osd-host.sh ssh-ed25519 AAAA... ceph-<fsid> http://172.19.1.1:8181 quay.io/ceph/ceph:v20
#   ./prepare-ceph-osd-host.sh "ssh-ed25519 AAAA... ceph-<fsid>" http://172.19.1.1:8181 quay.io/ceph/ceph:v20

# Separate the (possibly space-containing) public key from the optional proxy URL and the optional
# Ceph container image reference. Classification rules (order-independent):
#   - an http(s):// token is the proxy URL
#   - a token containing both '/' and ':' (e.g. quay.io/ceph/ceph:v20) is the Ceph image reference
#   - everything else is treated as part of the OpenSSH public key (which may span several tokens)
