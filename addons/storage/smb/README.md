## Introduction

The `storage smb` addon provides a Samba share in order to share files between the k2s nodes:

- smb share between k2s nodes can be either hosted by Windows or by Linux (Samba)
- smb share can be accessed by the node's OSs
- StorageClass "smb" based on this smb share for automatic storage volume provisioning

## Getting started

```
k2s addons enable storage smb
```

## Shared folder

The smb share is available under the following paths.

### Windows
