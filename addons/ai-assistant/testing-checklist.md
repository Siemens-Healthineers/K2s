# AI Assistant Addon — Testing Checklist

Use this checklist when validating the `ai-assistant` addon.  
The addon deploys the **Kagent** AI agent framework (with optional **Ollama** local LLM runtime) with **Kagent UI** as the sole AI interface.

> **How to use this file:**  
> Work top-to-bottom. Complete each numbered section before moving to the next.  
> Mark `[x]` when a check passes, add a note when it fails.

---

## One-time Setup (do this first, once per test session)

### Step 1 — Install K2s and enable ingress

```console
k2s install -f
k2s addons enable ingress nginx
```

Verify ingress is up:

```console
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

---

### Step 2 — Open Kagent UI in your browser

After enabling the addon (Step 3), access Kagent UI via:

**Option A — Ingress (requires `k2s.cluster.local` in hosts file):**
```
https://k2s.cluster.local/agents/kagent/k2s-assistant/chat
```

**Option B — Port-forward:**
```console
kubectl port-forward svc/kagent-ui -n kagent 8080:8080
```

Open: `http://localhost:8080`

Keep this browser tab open for the entire test session.

---

### Step 3 — Enable the AI Assistant addon

```console
k2s addons enable ai-assistant --provider ollama
```

This takes **5–15 minutes** on first run (model download + Kagent framework deploy).

Wait until Kagent pods show `Running`:

```console
kubectl get pods -n kagent -w
```

For Ollama provider, also verify the Windows service is running:

```console
Get-Service K2sOllama
```

---

### Step 4 — Verify the Kagent UI

1. Open the Kagent UI (see Step 2)
2. The UI should show available agents (e.g. `k2s-assistant` or `copilot-cli`)
3. Click on the agent to open the chat interface
4. The UI auto-connects to the Kagent controller — no manual configuration needed

---

## Section 1 — Addon Installation Checks

After `k2s addons enable ai-assistant` completes, run these commands to verify the installation.

---

### 1.1 — Ollama Windows service is running (ollama provider only)

```console
Get-Service K2sOllama
curl.exe -s http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

- [ ] Service `K2sOllama` is in `Running` state
- [ ] `/api/tags` response contains the configured model (e.g. `qwen2.5:7b`)

To list loaded models:
```console
ollama list
```

---

### 1.2 — Kagent namespace exists

```console
kubectl get ns kagent
```

- [ ] Namespace `kagent` exists

---

### 1.3 — Kagent controller is running

```console
kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployment/kagent-controller -n kagent --timeout=120s
kubectl logs -n kagent deployment/kagent-controller --tail=20
```

- [ ] `deployment/kagent-controller` becomes Available
- [ ] Logs show the controller started successfully

---

### 1.4 — A2A proxy is running

```console
kubectl get pods -n kagent -l app=a2a-proxy
kubectl get svc a2a-proxy -n kagent
```

- [ ] A2A proxy pod is `Running`
- [ ] Service `a2a-proxy` exists on port 8082

---

### 1.5 — Kagent UI is running

```console
kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployment/kagent-ui -n kagent --timeout=120s
```

- [ ] `deployment/kagent-ui` becomes Available

```console
kubectl get svc kagent-ui -n kagent
```

- [ ] Service `kagent-ui` exists on port 8080

---

### 1.6 — Status command shows all green

```console
k2s addons status ai-assistant
```

- [ ] `IsOllamaRunning          = True` (ollama provider only)
- [ ] `IsKagentControllerRunning = True`
- [ ] `IsA2aProxyRunning         = True`
- [ ] `IsKagentUiRunning         = True`
- [ ] `IsKagentIngressReady      = True`

---

## Section 2 — Kagent UI Checks

Verify the Kagent UI loaded correctly in the browser before running chat tests.

---

### 2.1 — Kagent UI is accessible

- [ ] Open the Kagent UI URL (see Step 2)
- [ ] The page loads without errors
- [ ] Agent list or chat interface is visible

---

### 2.2 — Agent is listed and selectable

- [ ] At least one agent is visible (e.g. `k2s-assistant` or `copilot-cli`)
- [ ] Clicking the agent opens the chat interface
- [ ] Chat input field is visible and accepts text

---

### 2.3 — Agent status is healthy

- [ ] The selected agent shows a healthy/connected status
- [ ] No error banners or connection failures displayed

If connection fails, check:
```console
kubectl get pods -n kagent
kubectl get svc kagent-controller -n kagent
```

---

### 2.4 — Chat history is accessible

- [ ] Previous conversations (if any) are listed in sidebar
- [ ] New conversation can be started

---

## Section 3 — Practical Chat Scenarios

> **Before each scenario:** The Kagent UI must be open and the agent must show a healthy status.  
> Type the exact prompt shown, press Enter or click Send, and wait for the full response.

---

### Chat Scenario A — "How is the cluster doing?"

**Purpose:** Basic cluster health summary. The easiest possible first test.

**No setup needed.**

**Type this prompt:**
```
How is the cluster doing? Give me a health summary.
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response arrives within 60 seconds
- [ ] Response mentions node(s) — e.g. "1 node is Ready" or similar
- [ ] Response mentions running namespaces or workloads
- [ ] Agent status stays healthy throughout

**Cross-check with kubectl:**
```console
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A --field-selector=status.phase!=Running,status.phase!=Succeeded
```

The AI answer should roughly reflect what these two commands show. It does not need to be exact — it should not invent namespaces or pods that do not exist.

---

### Chat Scenario B — "Why is my nginx pod failing?" (CrashLoopBackOff)

**Purpose:** Test K2s AI diagnosis of a crashing pod. The most common real-world debugging scenario.

**Setup — create a pod that always crashes:**
```console
kubectl run nginx-broken --image=nginx:latest -n default -- /bin/sh -c "exit 1"
```

Wait ~30 seconds, then confirm it is crashing:
```console
kubectl get pod nginx-broken -n default
```

Expected status: `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Error`

**Type this prompt:**
```
Why is the pod nginx-broken in the default namespace failing?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response arrives within 60 seconds
- [ ] Response mentions `CrashLoopBackOff`
- [ ] Response explains the container exits immediately (exit code 1)
- [ ] Response suggests checking logs with something like `kubectl logs nginx-broken --previous`
- [ ] Response does **not** suggest cloud-provider-specific fixes

**Cleanup:**
```console
kubectl delete pod nginx-broken -n default
```

---

### Chat Scenario C — "Pod is stuck in ImagePullBackOff"

**Purpose:** Test diagnosis of a bad image name — another very common real problem.

**Setup — create a pod with a made-up image:**
```console
kubectl run bad-image --image=doesnotexist-registry.io/fake:v99 -n default
```

Wait ~20 seconds, then confirm:
```console
kubectl get pod bad-image -n default
```

Expected status: `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff`

**Type this prompt:**
```
The pod bad-image in the default namespace is not starting. What is wrong with it?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response identifies `ImagePullBackOff` or `ErrImagePull`
- [ ] Response mentions the image name `doesnotexist-registry.io/fake:v99`
- [ ] Response suggests checking the image name/tag or registry access

**Cleanup:**
```console
kubectl delete pod bad-image -n default
```

---

### Chat Scenario D — "What pods need my attention?"

**Purpose:** Test scanning across all namespaces for multiple unhealthy workloads at once.

**Setup — create two different problem pods:**
```console
kubectl run crash-1 --image=busybox -n default -- /bin/sh -c "exit 1"
kubectl run pending-1 --image=nginx -n default \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"nosuchnode":"true"}}}'
```

Wait ~30 seconds, then confirm both are unhealthy:
```console
kubectl get pods crash-1 pending-1 -n default
```

Expected: `crash-1` = `CrashLoopBackOff`, `pending-1` = `Pending`

**Type this prompt:**
```
What pods need my attention right now?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response mentions `crash-1` with a crash-related reason
- [ ] Response mentions `pending-1` with a scheduling-related reason (no matching node)
- [ ] Response does **not** flag healthy system pods like `coredns` as problems
- [ ] Both issues are explained with different root causes

**Cleanup:**
```console
kubectl delete pod crash-1 pending-1 -n default
```

---

### Chat Scenario E — "Show me the logs of a failing pod"

**Purpose:** Test that the AI fetches and interprets real pod logs from the cluster.

**Setup — create a pod that prints an error and exits:**
```console
kubectl run log-test --image=busybox -n default --restart=Never -- \
  /bin/sh -c "echo 'ERROR: database connection refused'; sleep 2; exit 1"
```

Wait ~10 seconds:
```console
kubectl get pod log-test -n default
```

Expected status: `Error` or `Completed` (it ran and exited)

**Type this prompt:**
```
Show me the logs of the pod log-test in the default namespace and explain what went wrong.
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response includes the exact log line `ERROR: database connection refused`
- [ ] Response explains the pod exited due to the application error
- [ ] Response suggests a next step (e.g. check if a database service is reachable)

**Cleanup:**
```console
kubectl delete pod log-test -n default
```

---

### Chat Scenario F — "Generate a YAML for a nginx Deployment"

**Purpose:** Test YAML generation and the Apply button. No broken cluster state needed.

**No setup needed.**

**Type this prompt:**
```
Generate a Kubernetes YAML for a simple nginx Deployment with 2 replicas in the default namespace.
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response contains a YAML code block (syntax-highlighted, starts with `apiVersion:`)
- [ ] YAML contains `kind: Deployment`
- [ ] YAML contains `replicas: 2`
- [ ] YAML contains `image: nginx`
- [ ] An **Apply** button appears below the YAML block in the chat
- [ ] Clicking **Apply** opens an editor dialog with the YAML pre-filled
- [ ] Dialog title says `Apply Deployment` (not View or Delete)
- [ ] Clicking **Apply** in the dialog creates the deployment:
  ```console
  kubectl get deployment -n default
  ```

**Cleanup:**
```console
kubectl delete deployment nginx -n default
```
_(adjust the name if the AI used a different name like `nginx-deployment`)_

---

### Chat Scenario G — "How do I scale a deployment?"

**Purpose:** Test general Kubernetes how-to knowledge. No cluster setup needed.

**No setup needed.**

**Type this prompt:**
```
How do I scale the headlamp deployment in the dashboard namespace to 2 replicas?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response provides the exact `kubectl scale` command:
  ```console
  kubectl scale deployment headlamp -n dashboard --replicas=2
  ```
  _(or equivalent `kubectl patch` form — both are correct)_
- [ ] Run the command and verify it works:
  ```console
  kubectl scale deployment headlamp -n dashboard --replicas=2
  kubectl get deployment headlamp -n dashboard
  ```
  Expected: `READY 2/2`
- [ ] Scale back when done:
  ```console
  kubectl scale deployment headlamp -n dashboard --replicas=1
  ```

---

### Chat Scenario H — "Pod is stuck in Pending (resource limits)"

**Purpose:** Test diagnosis of a pod that cannot be scheduled because it requests more resources than any node has.

**Setup — create a pod with impossible resource requests:**
```console
kubectl run resource-hog --image=nginx -n default \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"resource-hog","image":"nginx","resources":{"requests":{"cpu":"100","memory":"500Gi"}}}]}}'
```

Confirm it is stuck:
```console
kubectl get pod resource-hog -n default
```

Expected status: `Pending`

**Type this prompt:**
```
The pod resource-hog in the default namespace is stuck in Pending state. Why?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response identifies insufficient CPU or memory as the cause
- [ ] Response mentions the requested values are too high for the available nodes
- [ ] Response suggests lowering the resource requests

**Cleanup:**
```console
kubectl delete pod resource-hog -n default
```

---

### Chat Scenario I — "What is running in the kagent namespace?"

**Purpose:** Test namespace-scoped resource discovery. Confirms the AI scopes queries correctly without confusion.

**No setup needed** — the kagent namespace is already running.

**Type this prompt:**
```
What is running in the kagent namespace?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Response lists deployments such as `kagent-controller`, `kagent-ui`, `a2a-proxy`
- [ ] Response mentions relevant pods and services
- [ ] Response does **not** confuse `kagent` namespace with `dashboard` or `default`

**Cross-check:**
```console
kubectl get all -n kagent
```

---

### Chat Scenario J — Multi-turn conversation (context memory)

**Purpose:** Verify the chat remembers context within the same session.

**No setup needed.** Use the same open chat session (do NOT click New Chat / Reset).

**Message 1 — ask about deployments:**
```
How many deployments are in the kagent namespace?
```

Note the answer — it should list the kagent deployments.

**Message 2 — follow up without repeating context:**
```
How many pods does the controller deployment have running?
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Message 2 response correctly refers to the `kagent-controller` deployment from Message 1
- [ ] Response does **not** ask "which deployment?" — it uses session context
- [ ] Answer matches:
  ```console
  kubectl get pods -n kagent -l app.kubernetes.io/component=controller
  ```

**Message 3 — test reset:**
- Click the **New Chat** or **Reset** button in the Kagent UI
- Type: `What were we just talking about?`

**What to check:**
- [ ] After reset, the AI responds with no memory of the previous conversation
- [ ] Response does not reference `kagent-controller` unprompted

---

## Section 4 — Disable and Cleanup Checks

Run these after the chat scenarios to verify clean teardown.

---

### 4.1 — Disable the addon

```console
k2s addons disable ai-assistant
```

After the command completes, verify each resource is gone:

```console
kubectl get ns ai-assistant
kubectl get ns kagent
kubectl get agents -A
kubectl get pods -n kagent
```

- [ ] All commands return `not found` or empty results

- [ ] The Kagent UI URL is no longer accessible (returns 404 or connection refused)

---

### 4.2 — Disable with `--keep-model-data`

Re-enable first:
```console
k2s addons enable ai-assistant --provider ollama
```

Wait for it to be ready, then disable with flag:
```console
k2s addons disable ai-assistant --keep-model-data
```

Check that Ollama service is stopped but models are preserved:
```console
Get-Service K2sOllama
# Service should still exist (stopped but not removed)
```

- [ ] K2sOllama service exists (stopped or absent — nssm service retained)
- [ ] Ollama model data on disk is preserved (check `~/.ollama/models`)
- [ ] All Kagent deployments, services, and RBAC in `kagent` namespace are gone:
  ```console
  kubectl get deploy,svc -n kagent
  ```

Re-enable and check model is not re-downloaded:
```console
k2s addons enable ai-assistant --provider ollama
ollama list
```

- [ ] Model was already available — no re-download required

---

## Section 5 — Additional Checks

These are quick spot-checks. Run them in any order after Section 1 passes.

---

### 5.1 — Double-enable returns a warning (not a crash)

```console
k2s addons enable ai-assistant
```
_(while it is already enabled)_

- [ ] Command returns a **warning** message: `already enabled, nothing to do`
- [ ] Exit code is non-zero (warning)
- [ ] No new resources are created

---

### 5.2 — Double-disable returns a warning (not a crash)

```console
k2s addons disable ai-assistant
k2s addons disable ai-assistant
```
_(second call while already disabled)_

- [ ] Second call returns a **warning** message: `already disabled, nothing to do`
- [ ] No error or exception

---

### 5.3 — Enable with a different model

```console
k2s addons enable ai-assistant --provider ollama --model phi3
```

- [ ] `ollama list` shows `phi3`:
  ```console
  ollama list
  ```
- [ ] Agent definition contains `phi3`:
  ```console
  kubectl get agents -n kagent -o yaml | Select-String phi3
  ```

Cleanup:
```console
k2s addons disable ai-assistant
```

---

### 5.4 — RBAC: Kagent tools cannot write to the cluster

```console
kubectl get clusterrole k2s-tools-reader \
  -o jsonpath='{range .rules[*]}{.verbs}{"\n"}{end}'
```

- [ ] Output contains only `get`, `list`, `watch` — no `create`, `update`, `delete`, or `patch`

---

### 5.5 — Additional model survives Ollama service restart

```console
ollama pull tinyllama
ollama list
Restart-Service K2sOllama
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
ollama list
```

- [ ] `tinyllama` appears in `ollama list` before the restart
- [ ] `tinyllama` still appears in `ollama list` after the restart (stored on disk)
