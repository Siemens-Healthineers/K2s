# dashboard

## Introduction

The `dashboard` addon provides a Kubernetes Dashboard which is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications runing in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

## Getting started

The Kubernetes dashboard can be enabled using the k2s CLI by running the following command:

```
k2s addons enable dashboard
```

### Intergration with metrics addon

By enabling the metrics addon, the dashboard addon can present the collected metrics in the dashboard UI.

The following commands enable the metrics addon and the dashboard addon:

```
k2s addons enable metrics
k2s addons enable dashboard
```

The metrics addon can be enabled while enabling the dashboard addon using the following command:

```
k2s addons enable dashboard --enable-metrics
```

### Integration with ingress nginx and ingress traefik addons

The dashboard addon can be integrated with either the ingress nginx or the ingress traefik addon so that it can be exposed outside the cluster.

For example, the dashboard can be enabled along with ingress traefik addon using the following command:

```
k2s addons enable dashboard --ingress traefik
```

_Note:_ The above command shall enable the ingress traefik addon if it is not enabled.

## Accessing the dashboard

The dashboard UI can be accessed via the following methods.

### Access using ingress

To access dashboard via ingress, the ingress nginx or the ingress traefik addon has to enabled.
Once the addons are enabled, then the dashboard UI can be accessed at the following links:
<https://k2s.cluster.local/dashboard/> (with HTTP using http://.. instead of https://..)

### Access using port-forwarding

To access dashboard via port-forwarding, the following command can be executed:

```
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard port-forward svc/kubernetes-dashboard 8443:443
```

In this case, the dashboard UI can be accessed at the following link: <https://localhost:8443>

_Note:_ It is not important to use port 8443 during port-forwarding. Any available port can be used.

### Login to dashboard

When the dashboard UI is opened in the browser, please press the **Skip** button. This allows the users to begin using the dashboard without generating the access token or using the KUBECONFIG file for login.

## Disable dashboard

The dashboard can be disabled using the k2s CLI by running the following command:

```
k2s addons disable dashboard
```

_Note:_ The above command will only disable dashboard addon. If other addons were enabled while enabling the dashboard addon, they will not be disabled.
