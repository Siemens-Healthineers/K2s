# The kubernetes-dashboard service exposes an angular application on port 443
# The angular application is design in such a way that it constructs the
# relative paths based on the value stored in the x-forwarded-prefix header
# of the request. So if the application is exposed on another path than root,
# this header must have as value that path.
---
# this MiddleWare will strip the prefix /dashboard from the request path
# and set the x-forwarded-prefix header of the request to /dashboard/
# see https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/stripprefix/

# this ingress will be merged with ingress provided in:
# addons/ingress/traefik/manifests/cluster-local-ingress.yaml
# and exposes the kubernetes-dashboard angular application on:
# https://k2s.cluster.local/dashboard/
# The certificate is taken from k8s secret 'k2s.cluster.local-tls'
# (see addons/ingress/traefik/manifests/cluster-local-ingress.yaml)
# The dashboard-add-bearer-token is created only is security is off.
