# The kubernetes-dashboard service exposes an angular application on port 443
# The angular application is design in such a way that it constructs the
# relative paths based on the value stored in the x-forwarded-prefix header
# of the request. So if the application is exposed on another path than root,
# this header must have as value that path.

# this ingress will be merged with ingress provided in:
# addons/ingress/nginx/manifests/cluster-local-ingress.yaml
# and exposes the kubernetes-dashboard angular application on:
# https://k2s.cluster.local/dashboard/
# The certificate is taken from k8s secret 'k2s.cluster.local-tls'
# (see addons/ingress/nginx/manifests/cluster-local-ingress.yaml)
# NOTE: there is a glitch in dashboard,
# causing the trailing / in bot URLs to be needed, i.e.
# https://k2s.cluster.local/dashboard will not work!
