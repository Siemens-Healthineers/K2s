# The kubernetes-dashboard service exposes an angular application on port 443
# The angular application is design in such a way that it constructs the 
# relative paths based on the value stored in the x-forwarded-prefix header
# of the request. So if the application is exposed on another path than root,
# this header must have as value that path.
---
# This ingress will expose the angular application on:
# HTTP: http://k2s-dashboard.local 
# TLS: https://k2s-dashboard.local 
# For TLS, the certificate is taken from k8s secret 'k2s-dashboard-local-tls'
# This secret will be created by cert-manager, if it is installed and running.
# If cert-manager is not installed, the secret will not be present and 
# traefik will use an own self-signed certificate.
