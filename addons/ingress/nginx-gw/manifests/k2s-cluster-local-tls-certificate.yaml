# CA-signed certificate for k2s.cluster.local
# This certificate is used by NGINX Gateway Fabric for TLS termination
# Unlike NGINX Ingress and Traefik which auto-generate default certificates at runtime,
# NGINX Gateway Fabric follows the Gateway API specification strictly, which requires
# explicit certificate references in the Gateway resource. The Gateway API design is
# security-first and fails closed - if you specify certificateRefs, the Secret MUST exist.
#
# Traditional ingress controllers (nginx/traefik) are permissive:
# - NGINX Ingress: Automatically creates a fake self-signed certificate on startup
# - Traefik: Auto-generates certificates on-the-fly for TLS entrypoints
# - Both work without pre-configuration for convenience
#
# Gateway API / NGINX Gateway Fabric is explicit and declarative:
# - Gateway resource MUST reference an existing Secret in spec.listeners[].tls.certificateRefs
# - No automatic certificate generation (security and predictability over convenience)
# - If the Secret is missing, TLS listeners will fail to bind, resulting in no TLS traffic
#
# This certificate is signed by the k2s-ca-issuer ClusterIssuer, which is automatically
# installed by the ingress nginx-gw addon via Enable-CertManager function.
# The CA root certificate is imported into the Windows trusted root store.
