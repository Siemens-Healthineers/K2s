# This Ingress serves as central ingress host for the cluster.
# Any ingress, in any namespace, can use the same hostname, and it will be
# merged with this one. See for example:
#  addons/dashboard/manifests/dashboard-traefik-ingress.yaml
#  addons/logging/manifests/opensearch-dashboards/traefik.yaml
# The certificate is taken from k8s secret 'k2s-cluster-local-tls'
# This secret will be created by cert-manager, if it is running.
# If cert-manager is not running, the secret will not be present and traefik
# will use an own self-signed certificate.
