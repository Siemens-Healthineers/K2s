# Secure Host Access

K2s provides three addons which can be used to expose the functionality implemented inside the kubernetes cluster outside of it: `ingress-nginx`,
`traefik` and `gateway-nginx`.

However, because the whole K2s solution relies on a private network, the exposed endpoints are only available inside this private network, running behind the Windows host - regardless which [hosting variant](../../README.md#hosting-variants) is used.

In this document, we will assume you have enabled the K2s addon `dashboard`, so it is usable on your local host at `http://k2s-dashboard.local`, and we further more assume you have an own product configured in one of the K2s ingress, reachable locally under `http://my-product.local`

If we want to expose the ingress / gateway endpoints outside of the windows host in a secure manner, we need to configure a reverse proxy on the windows host. The following picture shows this schematically for one of the variants:

![reverse-proxy](./images/reverse-proxy.drawio.png)

We describe here two ways to do that: using the addon `exthttpaccess` and using IIS.

## 1. Using the addon `exthttpaccess`

This K2s addon installs nginx as a windows service on the host, and configures it as a reverse proxy to the installed ingress addon. Products shall adjust the configuration.

See [NGINX Reverse Proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/).

The example shows how to make the two web applications K2s dashboard available outside your host, under an  **https** endpoint:

* `https://my-host.my-domain.com/dashboard` -> `http://k2s-dashboard.local`
* `https://my-host.my-domain.com/my-product` -> `http://my-product.local`

For this you need a server certificate issued by a trusted authority for the fqdn of your host, in this example `my-host.my-domain.com`

1. enable the K2s addon `exthttpaccess`

2. Update the configuration file `<k2s-install-dir>\bin\nginx\nginx.conf`

    ```conf
    ...
    http {
      server {
        listen 443          ssl;
        server_name         my-host.my-domain.com;
        ssl_certificate     my-host.my-domain.com.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key my-host.my-domain.com.key;

        location /dashboard/ {
          proxy_pass http://k2s-dashboard.local/;
          proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";
        }

        location /my-product/ {
          proxy_pass http://my-product.local/;
          sub_filter 'base href="' 'base href="/my-product';
          proxy_buffering off;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    * the `sub_filter` will replace e.g. `<base href="/app/"/>` with `<base href="/my-product/app/"/>`
    * the `proxy_buffering` needs to be turned off if the application uses  Server-Side-Events, which is a GET on an URL which is kept alive and on which the server can send events from time to time, to notify the UI about changes.

3. Restart nginx-ext using `nssm`, to use the updated configuration file:

   ```cmd
   nssm restart nginx-ext
   ```

**Open Points:**

* How can NGINX authenticate users against NTLM? The feature seems to be available, but only for NGINX Plus.
* Can NGINX use server certificates private key from the **windows certificate store**? Companies might have an established process to manage and distribute their server certificates, which on windows means they are created in the computer certificate store and their private key cannot be exported to be used by NGINX. IIS can use it from there.

## 2. Using IIS

Another way to expose the functionality outside of the windows host is to use the [Application Request Routing module for IIS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/planning-for-arr/using-the-application-request-routing-module) and the [URL Rewrite IIS Module](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) to configure a reverse proxy to the services exposed by the K2s ingress or gateway addon.

Using the IIS will ease up integration in the site network environment regarding secure communication and user management, as the IIS can be configured for SSL using the existing host certificate and the NTLM authentication can be configured in IIS.

The example below shows again how to make the same two applications available outside your host over **https**, and this time also making sure that the **user is authenticated** against the local host (i.e. he would also be allowed to log in on your local host):

* `https://my-host.my-domain.com/dashboard` -> `http://k2s-dashboard.local`
* `https://my-host.my-domain.com/my-product` -> `http://my-product.local`

Follow these steps:

1. Install the IIS Module  [Url Rewrite](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)
2. Install the IIS Module [Application Request Routing](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing)
3. In IIS Manager, navigate to your default Site and select `bindings` in the `Actions pane` on the right.

   Activate SSL binding for your default site in IIS. You need a server certificate to do that.

   ![iis-site-bindings](images/iis-site-bindings.png)

4. In IIS Manager, navigate to your default site and select `Authentication` in the `IIS` section of the `Features View`.

   Enable `Windows Authentication`:

   ![iis-windows-auth](images/iis-windows-auth.png)

5. In IIS Manager, select your computer (root node) and then select `Application Request Routing Cache` in the `IIS` section of the `Features View`. Then select `Server Proxy Settings...` in the `Actions pane`, and enable the proxy:

   ![iis-proxy-settings](images/iis-proxy-settings.png)

   Also activate the `Reverse rewrite host in response headers`.

6. Finally, in IIS Manager, navigate to your default site again, select `URL Rewrite`, and create your inbound and outbound rules. Alternatively, update the configuration file under
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config` and restart the site in IIS.

The example below shows how to forward requests to two different ingress endpoints, one of them being the K2s dashboard also used in the previous section.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
      <rules>
        <rule name="k2s-dashboard" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url="^dashboard/?(.*)" />
          <serverVariables>
            <set name="HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING" value="" />
          </serverVariables>
          <action type="Rewrite" url="http://k2s-dashboard.local/{R:1}" logRewrittenUrl="true" />
        </rule>
        <rule name="my-product" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url="^my-product/?(.*)" />
          <action type="Rewrite" url="http://my-product.local/{R:1}" logRewrittenUrl="true" />
        </rule>
      </rules>
      <outboundRules>
        <rule name="my-product-out" preCondition="isHTML" stopProcessing="true">
          <match filterByTags="Base" pattern="^/?(.*)$" negate="false" />
          <action type="Rewrite" value="/my-product/{R:1}" />
          <conditions>
            <add input="{URL}" pattern="/my-product.*" />
          </conditions>
        </rule>
        <preConditions>
          <remove name="isHTTP" />
          <preCondition name="isHTML">
            <add input="{RESPONSE_CONTENT_TYPE}" pattern="^text/html" />
          </preCondition>
        </preConditions>
      </outboundRules>
    </rewrite>
    <security>
      <authentication>
        <windowsAuthentication enabled="true" />
      </authentication>
    </security>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

Open Points:

* It seems that IIS Application Request Routing has an issue with URLs ending with a space character (as this is forbidden) - although NGINX is tolerant with this.

  The dashboard web application makes calls to APIs, and in many of them the namespace is used as REST API resource ID, e.g. all PODs of namespace `kubernetes-dashboard` are retrieved with this API call:

  `http://k2s-dashboard.local/api/v1/pod/kubernetes-dashboard?query=value&...`

  But when the user selects `All Namespaces` in the User Interface, the same URL is invoked with a space character (`%20`) as the name of the resource - it seems as this is the convention the developers of the Dashboard made:

  `http://k2s-dashboard.local/api/v1/pod/%20?query=value&...`

  The http specs forbid to have a space at the end on an URL, but it works for some reasons. However, when the rewrite rules kick in, it seems they drop the space and the Application is not working with All namespaces selected.

  This line in the kubernetes dashboard sources is causing the issue (the space character):

  [`return this.namespace_.isMultiNamespace(currentNamespace) ? ' ' : currentNamespace;`](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/modules/web/src/common/services/resource/resource.ts#L69)

## Base HREF

When configuring reverse proxies, special attention and test effort must be spent to ensure that URLs are properly handled, in case they are pointing to the services being re-directed to.

In our example above, the `my-product.local` app makes several calls to APIs using relative URLs.
The app is designed to work e.g. at `my-product.local/app`, and encodes the `<base href="/app/">`.
But when the application is accessed through the secure url at e.g. `my-host.my-domain.com/my-product/app`, the base url must be rewritten to `<base href="/my-product/app/">`.

This is solved for `my-product` by outbound rules, which inspects the responses and make the necessary changes, in both examples above.

For the dashboard, which is not setting the BASE HREF at all, and is installed at the root of the upstream, no change is necessary.

See the following stack overflow for a pertinent discussion on how the handling of the BASE for Relative URLs shall be done:
