K2s Features
==============
[ Home ](../README.md)

<br>![Image](/doc/assets/features.jpg)<br>

**K2s** includes the following features:
- support of mixed Windows and Linux K8s (Kubernetes) workloads
- support for multiple Windows 10,11 and Server OS versions
- multiple network card support, including support for LAN and WIFI network interfaces
- K2s supports 3 variants in hosting:
    
    1. **Host Variant**: here on the Windows host only one Virtual Machine is created and used as the Linux master and worker node.
This variant is also the default, it offers very low memory consumption and efficiency. Memory usage starts at 4GB.

    2. **Multi VM Variant**: for each node one virtual machine is created, minimum we have one Windows and one Linux node. Memory usage here starts at 10GB.

    3. **Development Only Variant**: in this variant we don't create a K8s cluster, only the environment to be able to build and test Windows and Linux containers.
