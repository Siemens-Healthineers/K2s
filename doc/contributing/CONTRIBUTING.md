## Building Locally

### Workspace Prerequisites

All the prerequisites mentioned in [Install Prerequisites](../k2scli/install-uninstall_cmd.md#installing) are necessary.

* Install [*Go*](https://go.dev/dl/) for *Windows*.

### Build *Go* projects

Building *Go* based projects is done through [BuildGoExe.ps1](../../smallsetup/common/BuildGoExe.ps1)

> `bgo.cmd` is a shortcut command to invoke script BuildGoExe.ps1.

If you have not installed *K2s* yet, then your PATH is not updated with required locations. In this case, look for bgo.cmd and invoke the build command. In the below example, `c:\k` is the root of our *Git* repo.

```PowerShell
PS> where.exe bgo
C:\k\bin\bgo.cmd
```

Building `httpproxy` *Go* project:

```PowerShell
PS> C:\k\bin\bgo -ProjectDir "C:\k\k2s\cmd\httpproxy\" -ExeOutDir "c:\k\bin"
```

 <span style="color:orange;font-size:medium">**ðŸ’¡**</span> `k2s` CLI can be built without any parameters:
```PowerShell
PS> C:\k\bin\bgo
```

To build all *Go* executables:
```PowerShell
PS> C:\k\bin\bgo -BuildAll 1
```

If *K2s* is installed then just simply execute command without full path.
```PowerShell
PS> bgo -ProjectDir "C:\k\k2s\cmd\httpproxy\" -ExeOutDir "c:\k\bin"
PS> bgo -BuildAll 1
```
---
## Testing 

<span style="color:orange;font-size:medium">**âš ** </span> Prerequisites: [Install *Pester*](powershell_dev.md#install-pester) and [Install *Ginkgo*](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#installing-ginkgo).

When you have made changes either to PowerShell scripts or Go projects, you can run all test suites in the repository via:

```PowerShell
PS> c:\k\k2s\test\execute_all_tests.ps1
```
<span style="color:orange;font-size:medium">**âš ** </span> Acceptance/e2e/system tests might require a running *K2s* cluster. See also [*K2s* Acceptance Testing](../../k2s/test/README.md).

To filter tests for e.g. executing only unit tests, use the **-Tags** and **-ExcludeTags** parameters:
```PowerShell
PS> c:\k\k2s\test\execute_all_tests.ps1 -Tags unit
```

> Inspect the script for further parameter details and descriptions.

### Tags/Labels
To control which tests or test types shall be executed in which context/environment, tags/labels can be utilized.
> See [*Pester* Tag Documentation](https://pester.dev/docs/usage/tags) for information about tagging/labelling Pester tests.<br/>
> See [*Ginkgo* Spec Labels Documentation](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-labels) for information about tagging/labelling Ginkgo tests.

#### *Pester* Example
Define one or more tags at any level of a test container:
```PowerShell
Describe 'Get-Status' -Tag 'unit', 'addon' {
    # ...
}
```
Execute tests with tag *unit*:
```sh
PS> Invoke-Pester <dir-with-test-files> -Tag unit
```

#### *Ginkgo* Example
Define one or more tags at any level of a test node, here for a whole test suite:
```Go
// ...
func TestHttpproxyUnitTests(t *testing.T) {
	RegisterFailHandler(Fail)
	RunSpecs(t, "httpproxy Unit Tests", Label("unit", "ci"))
}
// ...
```
Execute tests with tag *unit*:
```sh
PS> ginkgo --label-filter="unit" <dir-with-test-suites>
```

#### Commonly Used Tags
| Name                     | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **acceptance**           | end-to-end test/executable spec in production-like scenario                                                                |
| **integration**          | test requiring certain external resources/systems to be reachable or additional software to be installed                   |
| **unit**                 | test can be executed in isolation, all dependencies to the environment are mocked                                          |
| **ci**                   | test that is fast-running and therefore applicable to CI runs; applies most likely to all unit tests                       |
| **addon**                | test is addon-related and does not test *K2s* core functionality                                                           |
| **internet-required**    | test requires internet connectivity, e.g. for package downloads                                                            |
| **invasive**             | test changes either state of the host system or *K2s* installation                                                         |
| **read-only**            | test does not change state of the host system or *K2s* installation; optional, since read-only tests should be the default |
| **setup-required**       | test requires *K2s* to be installed; currently, the tests determine the setup type in the test runs                        |
| **no-setup**             | *K2s* must not be installed on the system to test pre-installation behavior                                                |
| **setup=\<setup name\>** | *K2s* setup type must match, e.g. *setup=k2s* or *setup=MultiVMK8s*                                                        |
| **system-running**       | test requires *K2s* to be started/running                                                                                  |
| **system-stopped**       | test requires *K2s* to be stopped                                                                                          |

### Pester Specifics
See [Automated Testing with Pester](powershell_dev.md#automated-testing-with-pester).

### Ginkgo/Gomega Specifics
#### Log Output Redirection
For diagnostic logging, *k2s* CLI uses [slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog). To redirect the log output to *Ginkgo*, set the *Ginkgo* logger as follows (*Ginkgo* uses [logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr/) internally):

```go
var _ = BeforeSuite(func() {
	slog.SetDefault(slog.New(logr.ToSlogHandler(GinkgoLogr)))
})
```

This enables control over *slog* output, i.e. the output can be enabled when running *Ginkgo* in verbose mode (`ginkog -v`) and be omitted in non-verbose mode.

## Submit Changes
The following guidelines apply to submitting changes to *K2s*:
- only commit changes when a corresponding issue exists and the maintainers have agreed that this issue is going to be realized (see [K2s Issues](https://github.com/Siemens-Healthineers/K2s/issues))
- since *K2s* is open source, we utilize the *GitHub's* [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) workflow:
  - forking the repo (applies to all non-maintainers)
  - creating a separate branch, commit to that branch and push
  - create a PR in *K2s* repo. This will trigger at least short-running automated tests.
  - the PR will be reviewed by the maintainers. If re-work is needed, preceding steps will be iterated. If the changes are acceptable, the PR will be merged to main.
- reference the issue in commit messages, e.g. for a refactoring issue with ID 42, create a message like `#42 refactor(addons): obsolete code path removed`. **Note:** This example also uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which is not mandatory, but recommended.
- sign your commits
  - signing commits increases trust in your contributions. Verified commit signatures will be display in GitHub like this: ![Verified Commit](./assets/verified-commit.png)
  
    Further readings: [Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits)
  - if you do not have a GPG key yet, see [Generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key). **Note:** If you are running on *Windows*, you can use the *Git bash* for `gpg` commands
  - if you have a GPG key in place, sign your commits. According to [Signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits), the following options exist:
    - sign every commit with `git commit -S -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"`
    - enable GPG signature for the whole local repo with `git config commit.gpgsign true`
    - enable GPG signature for all local repos with `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`
    
    **Note:** To avoid entering the passphrase for the GPG key too often, you can increase the expiration time, e.g. on *Windows* using [Gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/download.html) (see [How do I install and use gpg-agent on Windows?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66821816)). Alternatively, these settings can also be modified in this file: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\gpg-agent.conf`
  - see [Managing commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification) for more information
- run as many automated tests as possible, but at least the unit tests :`<repo>\k2s\test\execute_all_tests.ps1 -Tags unit`. Depending on the area of changes, consider running the appropriate e2e tests as well
