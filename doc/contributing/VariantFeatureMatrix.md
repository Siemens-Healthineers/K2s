**L2Bridge**: Creation of L2Bridge is essential for communication between pods across linux and windows node. In principle, a network adapter named `cbr0` is created to facilitate communication across nodes.

**DNSProxy**: Acts as internal DNS server on windows node. Status can be checked with cmd `nssm status dnsproxy`.

**HttpProxy**: Internal Proxy running on windows node. Status can be checked with cmd `nssm status httpproxy`. 
In order to access resource on internet the following proxy settings needs to be used:
- **host**: Proxy `http://172.19.1.1:8181` needs to be used inside Linux pods and Windows pods. Linux node needs the proxy as well.
- **multi-vm**: Proxy `http://172.19.1.101:8181` needs to be used only inside Windows pods. Linux node and Windows node can reach internet through NAT directly as well as Linux Pods.
- **linux-only**: No proxy needs to be used. Internet access is possible through NAT.

**Example**: `` curl www.example.com --proxy http://172.19.1.1:8181`` 

**VFPRules**: Dynamic rules added in cbr0 switch for windows containers networking.
